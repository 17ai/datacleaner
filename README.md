# datacleaner

A Python tool that automatically cleans data sets and readies them for analysis.

## datacleaner is not magic

datacleaner works with data in [pandas DataFrames](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html).

datacleaner is not magic, and it won't take an unorganized blob of text and automagically parse it out for you.

What datacleaner *will* do is save you a ton of time encoding and cleaning your data once it's already in a format that pandas DataFrames can handle.
